# 📝 To-Do List Web App

A simple and clean **To-Do List web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project allows users to add tasks dynamically, mark them as completed, and delete tasks using a trash icon.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters a task in the input field  
2. Clicking the **Add** button creates a new task dynamically  
3. Each task is displayed in its own box with:
   - A checkbox to mark completion
   - A delete button to remove the task  
4. Tasks are managed using JavaScript DOM manipulation
