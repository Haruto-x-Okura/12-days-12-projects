## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Timer Logic**: JavaScript manages countdown timers for work sessions (25 min default) and breaks (5/15 min)
2. **Background Upload**: Users can drag & drop or click to upload images/videos
3. **Brightness Analysis**: Canvas API analyzes uploaded media brightness (threshold: 128)
4. **Dynamic Theming**: Automatically switches text colors (black/white) for optimal contrast
5. **Session Tracking**: Calendar displays completed sessions and tracks productivity
6. **Notifications**: Browser notifications alert users of session transitions
